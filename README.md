# AI Receptionist for Event Management - TECKZITE

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Rasa Data Files
Ensure you have the following files properly configured with necessary intents, responses, and actions:
- `nlu.yml` (Contains intents and example user messages)
- `stories.yml` (Defines conversation flows)
- `domain.yml` (Defines responses, intents, and actions)

### 3. Train the Rasa Model
Run the following command to train the Rasa model:
```bash
rasa train
```

### 4. Run Rasa Servers in Parallel
Start two servers in parallel:

#### Run Rasa Actions Server:
```bash
rasa run actions
```

#### Run Rasa Main Server:
```bash
rasa run --enable-api --cors "*"
```

### 5. Interacting with the Chatbot
Once both servers are running, the chatbot interacts with users through `agent chatbot.js`. The chatbot:
- Processes user queries and refines responses from the Rasa model.
- Enhances responses with **Gemini API integration**.
- Provides complete information about **TECKZITE**, the event it is designed for.
- Sends **email reminders** to registered students 10 minutes before their scheduled events.
- Shows event locations using **Leaflet API** for precise navigation within **Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies, Nuzvid**.
